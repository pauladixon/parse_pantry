## Description:

This app was created in response to the current covid quarantine with the intention to enable a user to organize their available pantry items, working grocery lists, and any recipes on the docket. Pantry Parser enables any user to sign in through Google and create easily-editable lists to help organize cooking during the quarantine. This app also collects all recipe entries and makes them available to every other user, for a growing recipe database. The recipes currently included in the app are sourced from NYTimes Cooking and credited as such.

## Technologies Used:

- _Node_
- _Javascript_
- _HTML_
- _CSS_
- _Mongoose_
- _MongoDB_
- _Express_


## Next Steps:

- Link a recipe API to allow a user to add recipes from a database.
